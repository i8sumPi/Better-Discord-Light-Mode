# Better Discord Light Mode
A way to make discord light mode legible and less blinding.

Ok we all know that pretty much nobody uses discord light mode. But some people, like me, prefer it lighter, for a variety of reasons. The problem is, the original discord light mode has a lot of flaws. This simple chrome extension fixes them.

## What it does
1. Makes usernames readable by making them 40% darker. Many servers have usernames with very light colors that are nearly impossible to read in light mode - this fixes that.
2. Makes the background slightly darker, because an all white background is seriously blinding.
3. Makes unread channels stand out more by bolding them.

## Why Light Mode
It is less obvious you are on discord. Most productive websites have a white background, so discord's dark background kind of gives it away. Also, some people just prefer light mode in general. It should at least be *possible* to have light mode on discord.

# How To Use
Until I bother publishing this on the chrome web store, you're gonna have to download this manually. So sorry if it's kind of convoluted.

## 1. Download the extension
Click the download code button and download zip. Then unzip it and take out the folder `better-discord-light-mode-extension`.

## 2. Upload the extension
Go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode. Click "load unpacked" and upload the folder `better-discord-light-mode-extension` that is unzipped. 

And that's it! Hopefully it worked. If it didn't then please let me know.
